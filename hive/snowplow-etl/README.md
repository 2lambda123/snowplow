# SnowPlow::Etl

## Introduction

SnowPlow::Etl is a Ruby gem (built with [Bundler] [bundler]) to run the daily
ETL (extract, transform, load) job which processes the CloudFront access logs
generated by `snowplow.js` and turns them into SnowPlow-compatible, 
day-partitioned event files, all stored in Amazon S3.

Currently the SnowPlow::Etl gem performs the ETL process on Amazon Elastic 
MapReduce using Hive. A future version of this gem will offer a second ETL 
option using a "vanilla Hadoop" process on EMR.
